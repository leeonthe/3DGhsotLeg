**Description**

3D Ghost Leg is an interactive 3D application developed using the Unity Engine. 

The program allows users to create a network of lines or legs and connect them to each other.

Upon clicking a button, each generated animal follows the legs they are connected to, ultimately reaching the contents located at the bottom of the legs.

**Features**

3D Line Drawing: Create and visualize legs in a 3D space.

Animal Interaction: Generate animals that interact with the legs. Adjust the number of animals on the screen, ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 6, using the increasing/decreasing buttons.

Content Reveal: Discover the contents at the bottom of the legs through the animal's traversal. 

User Interaction: Engage with the application through a user-friendly interface.

**Installation**

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/leeonthe/3DGhsotLeg.git
